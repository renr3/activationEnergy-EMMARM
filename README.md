# activationEnergy-EMMARM

This repository contains the modules developed within the paper entitled "Influence of temperature in the early-age elastic modulus evolution of cement pastes and concrete".
Here you can find the Python module with the classes necessary to post-process EMM-ARM data to derive apparent activation energy estimates, as well as a Jupyter Notebook that produces the graphs shown in the aforementioned paper.
An example raw experimental data set (cp16 results) is included, so interested users can test the functionality of the code.
